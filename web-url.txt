1. Instead of storing the wishlist locally, fetch wishlist items directly from the API

>Need to change data-service.js 
  addWishListItem = item => {
  removeWishListItem = item => {

we need replace push and splice with API calls

2. Allow the creation of a new wishlist and POST it to the API. For help with POST see THIS

>Let us add a small new img link near the Wish List title -> it shd allow us to create a new wishListName
Above the actual list of item , we should allow a wishlist select drop-down
We need to implement change wish list functionality as well

3. Have one of the three product components display a video instead of an image. Your code should do a calculation to know which to show. You may have to add a videoURL field to the Mongoose Model in the API. Clicking the video should play it.

>Requires dynamic logic in product.js , during display
